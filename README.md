# Robot-Control-Interface
 this project is a simple web-based control interface for controlling a robot's movement directions and logging these movements into a MySQL database.

 First: Download and install XAMPP, which includes Apache and MySQL, to run the project locally on your computer.
 
 2. HTML: The HTML code provides a web interface that allows you to control the robot's movement directions (forward, backward, left, right, stop). The buttons in the interface send commands when clicked.
   
 3. PHP and POST: PHP is used to receive the commands sent by the HTML interface through POST requests. These commands are then logged into a MySQL database. This allows you to track and log every movement command issued to the robot in the database for future refernce or analysis
    
 4. PHP Code: The PHP code connects to the database and stores the commands related to the robot's movements, allowing you to track recorded movements.
